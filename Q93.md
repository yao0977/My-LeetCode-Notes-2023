# LeetCode Note: Restore IP Addresses

## Problem 

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between `0` and `255` (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.

* For example, `"0.1.2.201"` and `"192.168.1.1"` are valid IP addresses, but `"0.011.255.245"`, `"192.168.1.312"` and `"192.168@1.1"` are invalid IP addresses.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into `s`. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in `s`. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.


Example 1:
```
Input: s = "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "0000"
Output: ["0.0.0.0"]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "101023"
Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]
```


## Approach

### My Code

```java
class Solution {
    private static final int MAX_IP = 255;

    public List<String> restoreIpAddresses(String s) {
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        if (s.length() < 4){
            return ans;
        }

        splitR(s, ans, "", 0);
        return ans;
    }

    private void splitR(String s, List<String> list, String temp, int partCount){
        if (s.length() == 0 || partCount == 4){
            if (s.length() == 0 && partCount == 4){
                list.add(temp); 
            }
            temp = "";
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 3 && i < s.length(); i++){
            if (i != 0 && s.charAt(0) == '0'){
                break;
            }
            String part = s.substring(0, i + 1); // [0, i + 1)
            if (Integer.valueOf(part) > MAX_IP){
                continue;
            }
            if (temp.length() > 0){
               part = "." + part;
            }
            splitR(s.substring(i + 1), list, temp + part, partCount + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
public List<String> restoreIpAddresses(String s) {
    List<String> addresses = new ArrayList<>();
    StringBuilder tempAddress = new StringBuilder();
    doRestore(0, tempAddress, addresses, s);
    return addresses;
}

private void doRestore(int k, StringBuilder tempAddress, List<String> addresses, String s) {
    if (k == 4 || s.length() == 0) {
        if (k == 4 && s.length() == 0) {
            addresses.add(tempAddress.toString());
        }
        return;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length() && i <= 2; i++) {
        if (i != 0 && s.charAt(0) == '0') {
            break;
        }
        String part = s.substring(0, i + 1);
        if (Integer.valueOf(part) <= 255) {
            if (tempAddress.length() != 0) {
                part = "." + part;
            }
            tempAddress.append(part);
            doRestore(k + 1, tempAddress, addresses, s.substring(i + 1));
            tempAddress.delete(tempAddress.length() - part.length(), tempAddress.length());
        }
    }
}
```

### Issue with Original Code: Incorrect Concatenation in Recursive Call

In the original code for the `splitR` method, the problem lies in the way the `temp` variable is handled during the recursive calls. Let's go through the issues step by step:

1. **Concatenation inside the Loop:**
   In the `splitR` method, there is a loop that iterates over the possible parts of the IP address. Inside the loop, the current `part` is concatenated to the `temp` variable using the line: `temp = temp + part;`.

2. **Java Passes References by Value:**
   In Java, when you pass an object (like a `String`) as an argument to a method, the method receives a copy of the reference to that object. It means the method works with the same object in memory, not with a new copy of the object. However, if the method changes the value of the reference, it doesn't affect the original reference in the calling scope.

3. **Temp Variable in Previous Levels of Recursion Remains Unchanged:**
   Since the recursive call passes a copy of the `temp` variable to the next level of recursion, any changes made to this variable within the recursive call do not affect the `temp` variable in the previous level of recursion.

4. **Unexpected Behavior in Subsequent Iterations:**
   Due to the behavior described above, if we modify the `temp` variable in one recursive call, it won't affect the `temp` variable in the previous level. Consequently, when we come back to the loop for the next iteration, the `temp` variable will still have the value it had before the recursive call, leading to incorrect results in subsequent iterations.

### Fixing the Issue: Update Temp Variable in Recursive Call

To fix this issue, we need to pass the updated `temp + part` directly to the recursive call. By doing this, each recursive call will have its own separate `temp` variable, leading to the correct accumulation of IP addresses in the list. The correct code should look like this:

### Illustration of the Execution:

Now, let's illustrate the behavior of your original code with the example `s = "25525511135"`:

- `splitR("25525511135", list, "", 0)` (Initial call)

  Loop iteration 1:
  - `part = "2"`, `temp = "" + "2" = "2"`.
  - Recursive call: `splitR("5525511135", list, "2", 1)`.

  Loop iteration 2:
  - `part = "25"`, `temp = "2" + ".25" = "2.25"`.
  - Recursive call: `splitR("525511135", list, "2.25", 1)`.

  Loop iteration 3:
  - `part = "255"`, `temp = "2.25" + ".255" = "2.25.255"`.
  - Recursive call: `splitR("25511135", list, "2.25.255", 1)`.

  Loop iteration 4:
  - `part = "5"`, `temp = "2.25.255" + ".5" = "2.25.255.5"`.
  - Recursive call: `splitR("5511135", list, "2.25.255.5", 1)`.

  Loop iteration 5:
  - ... (continue the remaining iterations)
