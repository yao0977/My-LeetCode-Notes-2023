# LeetCode Note: Linked List Cycle

## Problem 

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## Approach

### My Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null){
            return false;
        }

        ListNode n1 = head;
        ListNode n2 = head;

        while (n1 != null && n2 != null && n2.next != null){
            n1 = n1.next;
            n2 = n2.next.next;
            if (n1 == n2){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

```

### Solution

```java
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null) {
        return false;
    }
    ListNode l1 = head, l2 = head.next;
    while (l1 != null && l2 != null && l2.next != null) {
        if (l1 == l2) {
            return true;
        }
        l1 = l1.next;
        l2 = l2.next.next;
    }
    return false;
}
```

*Using the two-pointer technique, where one pointer moves one node at a time and the other pointer moves two nodes at a time, if there is a loop present, these two pointers will eventually meet.
