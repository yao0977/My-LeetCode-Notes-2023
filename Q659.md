# LeetCode Note: Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences

## Problem 

You are given an integer array `nums` that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Determine if it is possible to split `nums` into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:

* Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).

* All subsequences have a length of 3 or more.

Return `true` if you can split `nums` according to the above conditions, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., `[1,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,3,2]` is not).

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 3, 4, 5
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to split nums into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 3 or more.
```


## Approach

### My Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPossible(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hypotheticalMap = new HashMap<>();

        for (int num : nums){
            freqMap.put(num, freqMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        for (int num : nums){
            int freq = freqMap.getOrDefault(num, 0);
            int hFreq = hypotheticalMap.getOrDefault(num, 0);

            if (freq > 0){
                if (hFreq > 0){
                    freqMap.put(num, freq - 1);
                    hypotheticalMap.put(num, hFreq - 1);
                    hypotheticalMap.put(num + 1, hypotheticalMap.getOrDefault(num + 1, 0) + 1);
                } else if (freq > 0 && freqMap.getOrDefault(num + 1, 0) > 0 && freqMap.getOrDefault(num + 2, 0) > 0){
                    freqMap.put(num, freq - 1);
                    freqMap.put(num + 1, freqMap.getOrDefault(num + 1, 0) - 1);
                    freqMap.put(num + 2, freqMap.getOrDefault(num + 2, 0) - 1);
                    hypotheticalMap.put(num + 3, hypotheticalMap.getOrDefault(num + 3, 0) + 1);
                } else{
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
// This is a greedy approach. The whole idea is to first look for an existing group
// to join for the current num. If no, then create a new group. 
// Here a group means group of 3 or more numbers as mentioned in question description. 

//Well, If u didn't understand, keep the above story of company in mind and try to understand the code below through comments, you will be fine.

class Solution {
    public boolean isPossible(int[] nums) {
        // This hashmap tells us about whether a number in num is available for a job or not
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> avaibilityMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // This hashmap tells a number (say x), if there is a job vacancy for them
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> wantMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // We store the count of every num in nums into avaibilityMap. Basically, a number's count is the avaibility of it.
        for(int i : nums){
            avaibilityMap.put(i, avaibilityMap.getOrDefault(i,0)+1);
        }
        
        // We iterate through each number in the nums array. Remember the story ? So, treat them like a person.
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            // First we check if our current num/person is available. If it is not we just continue with next num/person
            if(avaibilityMap.get(nums[i])<=0){
                continue;
            }
            
            // If the person is available, first we check if there is a job vacancy for him/her. Basically, is someone looking for him/her?
            else if(wantMap.getOrDefault(nums[i],0)>0){
                // Yes, someone is looking, so we decrease the avaibility count of that number
                avaibilityMap.put(nums[i], avaibilityMap.getOrDefault(nums[i],0)-1);
                
                // we also decrease its count from the job vacancy space / wantMap
                wantMap.put(nums[i], wantMap.getOrDefault(nums[i],0)-1);
                
                // Then as a goodwill, he/she will also create a job vacancy for (num[i]+1) in job vacancy space / wantMap, as we need consecutive numbers only
                wantMap.put(nums[i]+1, wantMap.getOrDefault(nums[i]+1,0)+1);
            }
            
            // Ooh, we are here means nums[i] was not able to find a job.
            // so, nums[i] tries to start his/her own company by checking avaibility of his/her friends i.e. (nums[i]+1) and (nums[i]+2)
            else if(avaibilityMap.getOrDefault(nums[i],0)>0 && avaibilityMap.getOrDefault(nums[i]+1,0)>0 && avaibilityMap.getOrDefault(nums[i]+2,0)>0){
                
                // Yay! both 2 friends are available. Let's start a company.
                // So we decrease the avaibility count of nums[i], (nums[i]+1) and (nums[i]+2) from the 
                // avaibilityMap
                avaibilityMap.put(nums[i], avaibilityMap.getOrDefault(nums[i],0)-1);
                avaibilityMap.put(nums[i]+1, avaibilityMap.getOrDefault(nums[i]+1,0)-1);
                avaibilityMap.put(nums[i]+2, avaibilityMap.getOrDefault(nums[i]+2,0)-1);
                
                // Also, as a goodwill, we create a new job vacancy for (nums[i]+3), as we need consecutive numbers only
                wantMap.put(nums[i]+3, wantMap.getOrDefault(nums[i]+3,0)+1);
            }
            
            // Bad luck case, nums[i] not able to start his/her company, so just return false
            else{
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // All good till here so we return true
        return true;
    }
}
```

Consider this hypothetical story to better understand this question:

1. Consider the numbers in the `nums` array are actual persons that are looking for a job. If they are available, they try to find a job. If no one wants them they go on to start their own company. But, here is the twist, a new company can be started only if it can have at least 3 persons available.

2. The most important thing to note here is that each person in `nums`, first tries to look for a job and if he/she does not gets success, he/she starts a company with 3 consecutive members. [As we want to find subsequences with consecutive numbers of length at least 3. Think a subsequence as a company for now.]

3. So, let's come to our first scenario - A person (let's say `x`) looks for a job and finds it. YAY!! So, this person joins an already existing company and then he/she creates a vacancy for another person `x + 1` in the job search section, so that another one like him/her do not have to face any struggle like he/she faced. He/She is a good guy/girl. No?

4. Now, let's come to our second possibility of our story. The guy/girl was not able to find a job :( 
BUT, he/she (let's say `x`) was very ambitious. So he/she decides - 'Let's build a company with me (that is `x`), `x + 1` and `x + 2`'. So he/she checks with `x + 1` and `x + 2`, if they are available to build a company as it requires 3 persons to start a company.

Here comes two scenario:

a. `x` finds both the potential teammates/partners, `x + 1` and `x + 2` to be available so, they go on to start a new company and then after finding their own company, as a goodwill they create a new job vacancy looking for `x + 3` so that `x + 3` do not face any struggle they faced. People are good, believe me :)

b. `x` was just out of luck, he/she was able to find their teammates i.e. `x + 1` and `x + 2`. In this case have hope and just return false to quickly complete the program execution.
