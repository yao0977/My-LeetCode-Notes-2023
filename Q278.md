# LeetCode Note: First Bad Version

## Problem 

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```


## Approach

### My Code

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        if (n == 1){
            if(isBadVersion(1)){
                return 1;
            } else{
                return 0;
            }
        }

        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left <= right){
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)){
                right = mid - 1;
            } else{
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        if (left <= n){
            return left;
        } else{
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
    int l = 1, h = n;
    while (l < h) {
        int mid = l + (h - l) / 2;
        if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
            h = mid;
        } else {
            l = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return l;
}
```

If the `mth` version is incorrect, it means the first bad version is between `[l, m]`. In this case, we set `h = m`. Otherwise, if the first bad version is between `[m + 1, h]`, we set `l = m + 1`.

Since the assignment expression for `h` is `h = m`, the loop condition should be `l < h`.
