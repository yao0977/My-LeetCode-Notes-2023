# LeetCode Note: Queue Reconstruction by Height

## Problem 

You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with exactly `ki` other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where `queue[j] = [hj, kj]` is the attributes of the `jth` person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).


Example 1:
```
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```


## Approach

### My Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        if (people.length == 0){
            return null;
        }

        Arrays.sort(people,
        ((x, y) -> x[0] == y[0]? x[1] - y[1] : y[0] - x[0]));
        
        List<int[]> queue = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < people.length; i++){
            queue.add(people[i][1], people[i]);
        }

        return queue.toArray(new int[queue.size()][]);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    int n = prices.length;
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    int soFarMin = prices[0];
    int max = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (soFarMin > prices[i]) soFarMin = prices[i];
        else max = Math.max(max, prices[i] - soFarMin);
    }
    return max;
}
```

`(a, b) -> (a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : b[0] - a[0])` is a lambda expression that represents a custom comparator. It defines the comparison logic between two elements a and b of the people array.

`a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : b[0] - a[0]` is a ternary operator (`? :`) that performs the following comparisons:

a. If the first elements of `a` and `b` (i.e., `a[0]` and `b[0]`) are equal, it compares their second elements by subtracting them: `a[1] - b[1]`.

For example, if `a` is `[2, 4]` and `b` is `[2, 6]`, the comparison `a[1] - b[1]` yields `-2` since `4 - 6 = -2`.

b. If the first elements are not equal, it compares their first elements by subtracting them: `b[0] - a[0]`.

For example, if `a` is `[3, 5]` and `b` is `[2, 6]`, the comparison `b[0] - a[0]` yields `-1` since `2 - 3 = -1`.

The `Arrays.sort()` method sorts the `people` array using the provided comparator, which determines the order of the elements based on the comparison results. If the result is negative (e.g., `a[1] - b[1]` or `b[0] - a[0]` is negative), it means `a` should come before `b` in the sorted array.
