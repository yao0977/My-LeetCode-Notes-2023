# LeetCode Note: Sqrt(x)

## Problem 

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

* For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```


## Approach

### My Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = x;

        while (left <= right){
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; 
            // to avoid stack overflow, 
            // the formula mid = (left + right) / 2 cannot be applied
            if ((long) mid * mid == (long) x){
                return mid;
            } else if ((long) mid * mid > (long) x){
                right = mid - 1;
            } else{
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
public int mySqrt(int x) {
    if (x <= 1) {
        return x;
    }
    int l = 1, h = x;
    while (l <= h) {
        int mid = l + (h - l) / 2;
        int sqrt = x / mid;
        if (sqrt == mid) {
            return mid;
        } else if (mid > sqrt) {
            h = mid - 1;
        } else {
            l = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return h;
}
```
