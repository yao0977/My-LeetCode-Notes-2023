# LeetCode Note: Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

## Problem 

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character `target`. There are at least two different characters in `letters`.

Return the smallest character in `letters` that is lexicographically greater than `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
Output: "x"
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
```



## Approach

### My Code

```java
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        if (letters.length == 1){
            return letters[0];
        }

        int left = 0;
        int right = letters.length - 1;
        

        while (left <= right){
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] > target){
                right = mid - 1;
            } else{
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        if (left < letters.length){
            return letters[left];
        } else{
            return letters[0];
        }
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
    int n = letters.length;
    int l = 0, h = n - 1;
    while (l <= h) {
        int m = l + (h - l) / 2;
        if (letters[m] <= target) {
            l = m + 1;
        } else {
            h = m - 1;
        }
    }
    return l < n ? letters[l] : letters[0];
}
```
