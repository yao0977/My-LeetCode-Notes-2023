# LeetCode Note: Non-overlapping Intervals

## Problem 

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.


Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```


## Approach

### My Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        int ans = 0;
        if (intervals.length == 0){
            return ans;
        }
        Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(o -> o[1]));
        
        int i = 0, j = 1;
        while (j < intervals.length){
            if (intervals[i][1] > intervals[j][0]){
                ans++;
            } else{
                i = j;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
    if (intervals.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(o -> o[1]));
    int cnt = 1;
    int end = intervals[0][1];
    for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < end) {
            continue;
        }
        end = intervals[i][1];
        cnt++;
    }
    return intervals.length - cnt;
}
```
