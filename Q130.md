# LeetCode Note: Surrounded Regions

## Problem 

Given an `m x n` matrix board containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.


Example 1:
```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],
                ["X","O","O","X"],
                ["X","X","O","X"],
                ["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```


## Approach

### My Code

```java
class Solution {
    private int n, m;
    private int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}}; 

    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        m = board.length;
        n = board[0].length;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            dfs(board, i, 0);
            dfs(board, i, m - 1);
        }

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            dfs(board, 0, j);
            dfs(board, n - 1, j);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if (board[i][j] == 'O'){
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                } else if (board[i][j] == 'T'){
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] board, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || board[i][j] != 'O') {
            return;
        }
        board[i][j] = 'T';
        for (int[] direction : directions) {
            dfs(board, i + direction[0], j + direction[1]);
        }
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
private int[][] direction = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
private int m, n;

public void solve(char[][] board) {
    if (board == null || board.length == 0) {
        return;
    }

    m = board.length;
    n = board[0].length;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        dfs(board, i, 0);
        dfs(board, i, n - 1);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dfs(board, 0, i);
        dfs(board, m - 1, i);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == 'T') {
                board[i][j] = 'O';
            } else if (board[i][j] == 'O') {
                board[i][j] = 'X';
            }
        }
    }
}

private void dfs(char[][] board, int r, int c) {
    if (r < 0 || r >= m || c < 0 || c >= n || board[r][c] != 'O') {
        return;
    }
    board[r][c] = 'T';
    for (int[] d : direction) {
        dfs(board, r + d[0], c + d[1]);
    }
}
```

Hint: Fill the outermost first, and the remaining is for the inner side.
