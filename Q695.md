# LeetCode Note: Max Area of Island

## Problem 

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.


Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```



## Approach

### My Code

```java
class Solution {
    private int area = 0;
    private int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};

    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int maxArea = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if (grid[i][j] == 1){
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                }
                if (area > maxArea){
                    maxArea = area;
                }
                area = 0;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }

    private int dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j){
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        if (i >= m || i < 0 || j >= n || j < 0 || grid[i][j] == 0){
            return 0;
        }

        if (grid[i][j] == 1){
            area += 1;
        }
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        // mark grid[i][j] as visited

        for (int[] direction : directions){
            dfs(grid, i + direction[0], j + direction[1]);
        }
        return area;
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
private int m, n;
private int[][] direction = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};

public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
    if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    m = grid.length;
    n = grid[0].length;
    int maxArea = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, dfs(grid, i, j));
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}

private int dfs(int[][] grid, int r, int c) {
    if (r < 0 || r >= m || c < 0 || c >= n || grid[r][c] == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    grid[r][c] = 0;
    int area = 1;
    for (int[] d : direction) {
        area += dfs(grid, r + d[0], c + d[1]);
    }
    return area;
}
```
