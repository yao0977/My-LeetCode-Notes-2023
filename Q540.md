# LeetCode Note: Single Element in a Sorted Array

## Problem 

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```



## Approach

### My Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        // nums has length at least 3r
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right){
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (mid % 2 == 1){
                mid--;
            }
            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]){
                left = mid + 2;
            } else{
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
}
```

### Solution

```java
public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
    int l = 0, h = nums.length - 1;
    while (l < h) {
        int m = l + (h - l) / 2;
        if (m % 2 == 1) {
            m--;   
            // ensure that l/h/m are all even numbers, 
            // so that the size of the search interval is always odd
        }
        if (nums[m] == nums[m + 1]) {
            l = m + 2;
        } else {
            h = m;
        }
    }
    return nums[l];
}
```

The requirement is to solve the problem in `O(log n)` time complexity, which means we cannot traverse the array and perform iteration operations, as it would have a time complexity of `O(n)`.

Let index be the position of the Single Element in the array. After the index, the previously paired states in the array are altered. If `m` is even and `m + 1 < index`, then `nums[m] == nums[m + 1]`; if `m + 1 >= index`, then `nums[m] != nums[m + 1]`.

From the above pattern, we can conclude that if `nums[m] == nums[m + 1]`, the position of the index in the array is `[m + 2, h]`. In this case, we set `l = m + 2`. If `nums[m] != nums[m + 1]`, the position of the index in the array is `[l, m]`. In this case, we set `h = m`.

Since the assignment expression for `h` is `h = m`, the loop condition should be `l < h`.
